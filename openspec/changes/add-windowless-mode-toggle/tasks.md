## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Confirm UI treatment for the window mode icon (states for windowed vs windowless).
- [x] 1.2 Add state management so the app starts windowed and toggles modes via the icon.
- [x] 1.3 Implement auto-hide of the window border after inactivity; restore on icon click.
- [x] 1.4 Update visuals/icon to reflect the current mode and window chrome visibility.
- [x] 1.5 Manually verify: launch defaults to windowed, toggle both directions, auto-hide triggers and can be restored via the icon.
